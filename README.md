This project was my final solo project for my coding course, Project Icarus. 

Project Icarus was designed and coded solely by myself, and was my version of a purchase ledger software interface (solely from the user perspective of an expenditure officer). The software allows the user to check open purchase orders, key an invoice, check keyed unmatched invoices, match an invoice to a purchase order dependant on receipted value, and finally view the matched invoices on the latest payment run. 

Project Icarus was written with a Python backend (Flask)  and JavaScript frontend (React), along with PostgreSQL for the database side. I used Postico for the database, and also used Mockoon to test the frontend code was functional. This project was written front- backend so testing of the frontend code before commiting to the large amount of seed data was a priority. The database was written by me, no external data (eg. APIs) was used, I calculated the amounts and worked out the keys myself. 

This project was completed with a 2 week deadline, so this is something I consider a first version of something I would like to continue extending and adding more features to.

The frontend design was made up of CSS with Material UI components. This was a challenge I set myself as I had wanted to learn how to incorporate material UI to make the buttons etc. look as visially clean as possible. 

The style choice of hot pink was chosen purely because in my years of accounting I had only ever encountered blue themed software! 


Extensions I would like to add:
<p>
-A departmental spend chart
</p>
<p>
-Requisitioner spend
</p>
<p>
-Authentication for multiple users
</p>
<p>
-Management Accounting add on for working out requisitoner budgets etc.
</p>
<p>
-An expenditure officer "processed today" count (eg. productivity tracker)
</p>
<p>
-Search by further fields than supplier
</p>

Thank you for reading!
